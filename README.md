# Spell-Checker

For this project I implemented a HashTable from scratch and implemented it to make a spell checker that autocorrected words based on a given input


To run: The spell checker will take three command-line parameters: filename of the dictionary, name of the file to be checked (check file), name of the output file where the checked (and may be corrected) content should be written to. Try:
'./proj5.x dict.txt test0.txt test0.out'

If you wish to make your own... make sure that the makefile is in the directory and type "make" this will produce an executable file for you to run.

workspace2 is the directory with the most up to date version of the hashtable and the test files needed.
